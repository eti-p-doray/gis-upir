This repository is a playground containing my work on gis tools.

Structure
=========
This repository grew in an ad-hoc fashion and it's structure is likely to change.
Here is the description of the current structure.

interactive : Web application used to vizualize shapefile/geojson data on a Map.
script : Various python scripts for analysis, notably map matching.
gis : some low-level io utility in c++, mostly abandonned.
data : This folder is not being tracked, but some tools assume it exists.
